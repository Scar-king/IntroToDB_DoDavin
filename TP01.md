   ```
5. Show information of customer, if the creditlimited is greater than 80 000, then the customer is vip. If
not he is normal.

    ```
    σ_customerName = 'La Rochelle Gifts' (customers) ⨝_customers.customerNumber = orders.customerNumber (orders) ⨝_orders.orderNumber = orderdetails.orderNumber (orderdetails) ⨝_orderdetails.productCode = products.productCode (products)
    ```
15. Show customer’s name who has ordered more than 15 products in once.
    ```
    γ_customerNumber, SUM(quantityOrdered) > 15(orderdetails ⨝ orders ⨝ customers)
    ```

    ```
18. The same as number 14, but we want months as columns and incomes, purcase_expense, and prot as

    PIVOT (
      γ_month(orderDate);
        SUM(quantityOrdered * priceEach) AS income,
        SUM(quantityOrdered * buyPrice) AS purchase_expense,
        SUM(quantityOrdered * (priceEach - buyPrice)) AS profit
      (
        σ_customerName = 'La Rochelle Gifts' (customers)
